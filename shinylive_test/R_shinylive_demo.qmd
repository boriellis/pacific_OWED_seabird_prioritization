hello!!

```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true

library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(dplyr)

# Define your Shiny UI here
ui <- fluidPage(
  # Your UI components go here (this is what the user would change - like weighting, drop down, text box, etc)
)

# Define your Shiny server logic here
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  # Your server code goes here (this is the bit where it determines what to do with the inputs - so making the plot, outputting the priority chunks, etc)
}

# Create and launch the Shiny app
shinyApp(ui, server)
```
