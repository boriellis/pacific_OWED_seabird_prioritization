#a loop that makes all the maps and saves them to folders somewhere 
#so, a loop to take each of the maps and calculate each of the proportions and save them to the dataframe (like the loop i wrote in 01_density_script)
#do that once per species
#to get mean low and high for each species - need each of those columns for each of the expert maps 
#eventual goal is making nine lines of data - columns are each lease area, propCA, propOR, propALL, rows are mean low and high for each unk species
#that would then get combined with the cleaned_data file in the app folder and a new version will get put in there

#the below code works and is the way to do it from a df column:

rastlist2 <- paste0(model_names, ".tif")

# Load the rasters using file.path
allrasters <- rast(file.path("data/raw_data/annual_densities", rastlist2))

# Multiply each raster by its weight
weighted_rasters <- allrasters * rastweight

# Sum and rescale to 0â€“1
weighted_raster <- sum(weighted_rasters)
weighted_raster <- weighted_raster / global(weighted_raster, "max", na.rm = TRUE)[1,1]

plot(weighted_raster)


#testing one row 

rastlist2 <- c("LAAL.tif", "BFAL.tif", "LESP.tif", "MUPE.tif") #make a list of the file names for a single species 
rastweight <- c(.25, .25, .25, .25)
allrasters <- rast(file.path("data/raw_data/annual_densities", rastlist2)) #load in all the rasters for the species 
# Apply the weights
weighted_rasters <- allrasters * rastweight
# Sum the weighted rasters
weighted_raster <- sum(weighted_rasters)
#rescale to 1 again
weighted_raster <- weighted_raster / global(weighted_raster, "max", na.rm = TRUE)[1,1] #rescale from 0-1

#ok that all worked
